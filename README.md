Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. How to manage NSDictionary, such as move data from one NSDictionary to another, and better way to apply search method to NSDictionary.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Most parts are very straight forward, just some small issues and I can just google and find the solution. The most challenging part is the SearchBar, I able to get it working, but I think there should be a better way to do it.
